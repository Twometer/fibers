# Overview

Fibers is a fast and simple message bus and relay server for JSON messages.

A single fiber is essentially a message bus, but it can be configured to do different things, depending on
its [operating mode](operating_modes).

To get started with installing the Fibers server, check out the [usage documentation](usage).
